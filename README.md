# airport-controller
### Final Project for "Multimedia Technology" course at ECE NTUA

In this project, I developed an application that facilitates the management of airplane parking at an airport and provides all relevant services. The application was implemented in JavaFX, using Scene Builder and Intellij IDEA. Specifically, through the Scene Builder, I created the .fxml files related to the interface and then I implemented in Java all controllers (for the control of the GUI and for the implementation of all services).
